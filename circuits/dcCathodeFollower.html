	<div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 12;">The DC Cathode Follower is a combination of a triode amplifier stage followed by a triode cathode follower that is directly connected to the amplifier output. This means that the follower's cathode is essentially at the same voltage as the anode of the amplifier stage.</div>
	<div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 12;">Under "normal" circumstances, there is no particular magic to the design and the two circuits do not need to be designed or analysed together. However, it is a stage used in many guitar amplifiers and is generally built with a 12AX7 which has plenty of gain but limited current drive. The limited current drive means that it as not a good choice as a cathode follower and the typical configuration means that the operating point of the follower is "dangerously" close to the Vg1 = 0v curve. This isn't dangerous in terms of risking damage to the device but in terms of forcing the follower to operate with positive grid voltages which, in turn, results in grid current that loads the amplifier stage. The overall effect of this is to introduce soft clipping to one half of the signal which introduces even harmonic distortion - which sounds musical as the 2nd and 4th harmonics are tonally related to the fundamental.</div>
	<div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 12;">The default parameters will illustrate where the bias points should be if used with a 12AX7 for the device.</div>
