	<div style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Pentode Common Cathode</div>
	<div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 12;">The pentode common cathode circuit is a very close relative of the triode common cathode amplifier (albeit with the potential for higher gain) and is typically used in a very similar way. A screen resistor is used to bias the screen as a function of the quiescent screen current - larger screen resistors will lower the screen voltage and so lower the gain of the circuit.</div>
	<div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 12;">While the pursuit of gain is not necessarily paramount, this circuit can influence the sound of an amplifier as a consequence of decoupling the screen with an appropriately chosen capacitor. If the screen is unbypassed then an increase in anode current will lead to a proportional increase in grid current. In turn, this will lower the screen voltage and the gain, i.e. local negative feedback is introduced that reduces the gain. Decoupling the screen (to the cathode) removes this negative feedback - but with a time constant determined by the capacitor and the screen resistor. If the signal is low then the effect of the negative feedback is negligible but, for larger input signals, this leads to a natural compression effect that is typically musical (i.e. the time constant is of the order of 10s of milliseconds). As noted, however, the effect will not be heard if the stage is not driven suitably hard so this stage needs to not be the first stage in a guitar amplifier for this to be effective.</div>
