	<div style="font-size: 12px; margin-top: 12;">The AC Cathode Follower acts as a buffer, i.e. it increases current drive without providing any voltage gain and is entirely analagous to a JFET source follower. With valves, the circuit can take a few forms depending on a) whether you bias it with a resistive divider or with a cathode resistor, and b) whether you use a triode or a pentode. It is typical to use a triode for a cathode follower as it generally provides plenty of available output swing. Biasing a triode with a resistive divider is trivial, so this circuit is for designing a cathode biased, triode cathode follower.</div>
